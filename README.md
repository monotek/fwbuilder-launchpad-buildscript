# fwbuilder-launchpad-buildscript

http://www.fwbuilder.org was discontinued and a slightly newer version was available from the https://github.com/UNINETT/fwbuilder repo.

Seems there is some progress to move fwbuilder.org to a new owner.

Its the developer who did the version for UNINETT before.

Current version can be found in the new fwbuilder repo:

https://github.com/fwbuilder/fwbuilder

This scripts helps building a version for Ubuntu.
